## Introduction
Before creating my Promoes website, I wanted to get an idea of how the website will look like so I decided to use Figma for designing and prototyping even though I have zero experience with the it.

## Timeline
### 2022-04-19
I tried diving into creating a mockup right away but quickly got stuck at the navbar. I was not able to figure out how to properly prototype a navbar button while using it as a component. Thankfully, I came across a great [Figma Community File](https://www.figma.com/community/file/911320742349428744) made by Crystal Tong that demonstrates the concept of Interactive Components, Auto Layout, and [Variants](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056440594-Create-and-use-variants) in Figma design.
### 2022-04-20
Using what I have learned, I started recreating the mockup from scratch again. This time, I am starting with basic components. So far, I have created a color palette and link it with Color Styles. I also started creating a basic set of icons that will be used throughout the website.
### 2022-04-21
I was able to pick up the pace and created components for the navbar, the footer, the logo, buttons, cards, and tags. Using all of these, I created a working prototype of the home page. I am proceeding onward to create the project page by creating a general design of the page.
### 2022-04-22
I finished creating the project page with a paginated project cards and search bar. Honestly, most of my time was spent on creating a tile pattern for the background in Figma. Unfortunately, the tiles in Figma were two pixels off, which became apparent when all of them were arranged together. In the end, I used MS Paint to stack and make all the minor adjustments for the background.
### 2022-04-23
I recreated and reorganized the website layouts to be more modular. In addition, I added variants for dark and light modes. I later finished the page for blogs and tried to make recreate the pagination system in Figma but came across a bug that would not let me prototype more than 3 state changes for nested component. I decided revisit this when I have more time and continued onward by creating a page for posts.
### 2022-04-24
I used the same post component for about page since I wanted it to be configurable using Markdown format. With that, the mockup is completed. Although there are some items that I will revisit in the future, I wanted to get started with creating the website and fix them along the way.
