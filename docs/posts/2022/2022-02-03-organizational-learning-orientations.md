## Introduction
Today in the knowledge society of the developed world, knowledge-intensive firms compete in their respective sectors to provide better services to their clients. Their knowledge processes, including the acquisition and utilization of both formalized technical knowledge and client-focused knowledge, play a major role in determining their success (Hislop et al., 2018). However, this assumes that knowledge workers are ideal employees with perfect willingness to participate in the desired processes. In reality, tensions may arise between the workers and their employers over how their knowledge is utilized. In addition, different learning modes such as exploration and exploitation are conflicting in principle. Thus, if a firm were to use all the learning orientations, it would have to reconcile the opposing learning orientations as well as having its knowledge workers willingly practice them.

## Learning Modes and Temporal Frames
Learning orientations depend upon two primary dimensions, the learning mode and the temporal frame under which the firms operate (Hislop et al., 2018). For the learning modes, both exploration of new knowledge and exploitation of preexisting knowledge are essential for organizational learning. Exploitation allows organizations to mature through refinement of their existing technology and provide stability, but the institutionalization of learning can make the entire process rigid. On the other hand, exploration allows organizations to adapt to the changing environment, but an ever-changing process can be chaotic and new ideas may never be fully utilized. A firm should practice a balance of both, but it is certainly difficult to marry both modes as the “processes of exploration may bring into question, challenge, undermine, and even replace institutionalized norms (knowledge and practices) embedded in exploitation processes” (Hislop et al., 2018, p. 95). However, organizations can embed the explorative side of learning into the standard processes, effectively creating processes with some level of flexibility to change. It is similar to the fifth level of the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) model where processes are quantitatively measured and controlled in such a way to continually optimize them (Chaudhary & Chopra, 2017). Given the potential benefits of the ambidextrous learning style, all knowledge-intensive firms, knowingly or unknowingly, are practicing it at a varying level (Reese, 2021). Nowadays, firms must balance the learning modes to remain competitive. For the temporal frame aspect, firms can utilize an accelerated or a planned timescale. Hislop et al. (2018) noted that an adaptive and creative workforce is suitable to operate under an accelerated timescale, while a workforce with high client capital is preferred for planned timescale. Thus, the HR would focus on recruiting workers with different skills based on the firm’s primary temporal frame. However, like the learning modes, the temporal frames are not mutually exclusive. A firm can have a varying mix of both workforces based on their client base and their typical workload. A law firm with well-established procedures may invest more in their client capital while an agile software firm may emphasize more on creativity.

## Effects on Knowledge Workers
When implementing changes in the knowledge management processes, the firm must take in account the possible downstream effects on its knowledge workers. Afterall, knowledge workers are the core of knowledge-intensive firms and any factors inhibiting their willingness to learn will break the dynamics of organizational learning. Unjustified changes may betray expectations and cause intra-organizational conflicts or conflicts between workers and their employers (Hislop et al., 2018). While an organization needs to adapt to different learning orientations based on the situation, a worker may not be comfortable with the new learning orientation and inhibit learning at the individual and group levels. In addition, the skills required under creative combination and expert solutions orientations are fundamentally different so the worker’s performance will suffer when switched. To avoid such conundrum, the management can introduce an ownership-focused learning culture, similar to how Pfizer did, by “developing employees based on their unique competencies” (Hislop et al., 2018, p. 80). Workers will feel more fulfillment working on their own competencies while the firm gains workforce adaptability. Additionally, the practice enhances the efficiency of the knowledge workers and makes them more resilient to changes (Hislop et al., 2018).

## Conclusion
Originally, the purpose of this post was to find how easily knowledge-intensive firms can switch between the four learning orientations. However, it appears that these orientations are situational and that firms need to practice a blend of all four and shift between them as needed. When a firm takes this holistic approach, moving across the orientations becomes a matter of resource allocation. Combined with a learning culture that focuses on honing knowledge workers’ strengths, the firm can adapt to changes in the environment without internal conflicts. While these practices will take time to introduce and increase management complexity, the firm will not only remain competitive but prosper when implemented properly.
