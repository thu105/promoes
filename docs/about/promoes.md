## Introduction
The original intention of Promoes was to serve as a simple portfolio website for me. The website was created back in 2015 from a free web template made by [Styleshout](http://www.styleshout.com/) as I had little experience in front-end development.

As years passes, I attempted multiple times to add more features and failed to achieve the result I desired, which is a portfolio website with blogging features based on a popular front-end framework. Now, this is the result I got after spending a week of my Spring Break learning about VueJS and its frameworks. If you want to know about my endeavor, please check out this [post](/post/2022/05/01/recreating-promoes/).

## Why the name "Promoes"?
The short answer is it is the cheapest domain I could afford. I chose Promoes because it is a combination of professional and my middle name, Moe. While Burmese names do not have a family name, all my siblings have Moe in their names so I wanted to pay tribute to my unofficial Moe family.  

## Credit
Obviously, this website would not be possible without the foundation provided by the teams at [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/), [VuePress](https://v2.vuepress.vuejs.org/), and [Gungnir](https://v2-vuepress-theme-gungnir.vercel.app/).

## Todo
- I want to first configure Gungnir to be compatible with VuePress [v2.0.0-beta.40](https://github.com/vuepress/vuepress-next/compare/v2.0.0-beta.39...v2.0.0-beta.40).
- I want to further extend the theme to tweak the features so that it matches to my liking.
